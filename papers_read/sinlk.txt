Method:

- Focusses on node granularity, and promoting whole paths
- Uses heuristics like giving preference to upper nodes for keeping in fast memory (logical)
- Using leafs for tracking path access frequency is also a good idea which seems obvious upon reading (but isn't actually).
- Also single point of transition from fast to slow memory along a path is logical as well, and the methods used to achieve that are straightforward but make sense.
- Since focussing on nodes, needs own node metadata bookkeeping (mentioned as part of frontend module)
- Apart from that, uses common techniques :
    - background asynchronous promotions/demotions
    - dynamic watermark adjustment
    - migration trigerred on breach of watermark and at some interval
    - halves access frequency periodically to give preference to recent accesses
- Since defines own metadata, that needs to be included in the index code. (Application modification, though claimed to be pretty less)


Evaluation:

- Microbenchmark: Focusses on skewed accesses (like us) -> 90% requests to 5% keys.
- Macrobenchmark : YCSB (with Zipfian) (can be given a thought)
- Also mixes reads and updates (like us).

- Baseline : Weighted interleave NUMA allocation (hmm)
- Uses TPP, MEMTIS, Caption for comparisons (along with some other optimized index variants)

- For microbenchmark, creates an ideal case to compare with all hot paths in fast memory initially (i think they can do this because it's a synthetic workload for microbenchmark so they can control the hot paths created and their allocation with their module)

- Across cases, they show it to be having a better throughput, lower average and tail latencies, nice scalabalit with threads. Esp good on read-heavy workloads (perhaps due to keeping a lock on writes while migrating)

- Interesting : Sensitivity analysis : Can be included in our setup: Dynamic workload change : Shifting entire hot region in microbenchmark at some interval

- Analysis of contribution of each indiviudal factor is also a good idea.

- Lastly, picks two traces with largest WSS from Alibaba Block Traces for real-world evaluation
